# CRM Extensions

The CRM Extensions folder stores CIDOC CMR extensions found at http://www.cidoc-crm.org/collaboration_resources. Differently from the official releases, we re-engineer the extensions in OWL and align them to the Erlangen formalization of CIDOC v.6.2.

# SPARQL Generate mappings

The folder stores SPARQL Generate mappings between projects-based datasets and the IPAT-O.
Status: testing.
